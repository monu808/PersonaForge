# Quick Fix: What to Do About the "Account Not Found" Error

## 🎯 **Recommended Solution: Use Testnet**

Since you're developing and testing PersonaForge, the best approach is to use Algorand testnet:

### Step 1: I've already configured testnet
✅ The app is now configured to use testnet by default
✅ Enhanced error handling prevents crashes
✅ Network switcher allows easy switching

### Step 2: Get testnet ALGO
1. **Open the analytics dashboard** (Coruscant → Monetize → Analytics)
2. **Click "Open Testnet Faucet"** in the network switcher
3. **Enter your wallet address** and get free test ALGO
4. **Wait 30 seconds** for the transaction to process

### Step 3: Test your features
- Create persona services with test ALGO
- Test payments without real money
- Use all Nodely features safely

## 🌐 **Alternative: Use Mainnet (Production)**

If you want to use real ALGO:

### Option A: Fund your existing address
- Send at least 0.1 ALGO to `PZ22V3RODVFQSHPEKX2ULL55VSVLAB6L7VCKP4MSPSOPJT22F6ZYGP5RJA`
- The account will become active and show up in analytics

### Option B: Create a new mainnet address
- In your wallet, ensure you're connected to Algorand mainnet
- Generate a new address if needed
- Fund it with real ALGO
