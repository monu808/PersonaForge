# TAVUS Persona Integration Guide

## Issue Fixed: Personas Not Creating in TAVUS

**Problem**: When creating personas through the PersonaForge interface, they were only being created locally in the database but not in TAVUS. This meant that while personas appeared in your local dashboard, they weren't available for TAVUS video generation, conversations, or other TAVUS features.

**Solution**: We've now integrated the persona creation process to automatically create personas in both your local database AND in TAVUS.

## How It Works

### 1. Automatic TAVUS Integration
When you create a persona through PersonaForge, the system now:

1. **Creates the persona locally** in your database
2. **Automatically creates a corresponding TAVUS persona** using the TAVUS API
3. **Links them together** by storing the TAVUS persona ID in your local persona record
4. **Handles errors gracefully** - if TAVUS creation fails, your local persona is still created with a warning

### 2. Persona Creation Process

```typescript
// The enhanced createPersona function now:
const { data, error } = await createPersona({
  name: "Your Persona Name",
  description: "Persona description",
  traits: selectedTraits,
  replicaType: "professional",
  systemPrompt: "Custom system prompt",
  context: "Additional context"
});

// This will create:
// 1. Local persona in your database
// 2. TAVUS persona via API call
// 3. Link between them for seamless integration
```

### 3. TAVUS Persona Features

The TAVUS persona is created with:
- **Personality Layers**: Including LLM settings, TTS configuration
- **System Prompt**: Your custom instructions for the persona
- **Context**: Additional background information
- **Replica Integration**: Links to existing replicas if provided

## Using the Sync Feature

### If You Have Existing TAVUS Personas

If you already have personas created directly in TAVUS that aren't showing up in PersonaForge:

1. Go to **Tavus Features** page
2. Look for the **"TAVUS Persona Sync"** card
3. Click **"List TAVUS Personas"** to see all your TAVUS personas
4. Click **"Sync to Local"** to import them into PersonaForge

### Sync Process

The sync feature will:
- Fetch all personas from your TAVUS account
- Create local persona records for any that don't already exist
- Link them properly for full integration
- Skip personas that are already synced

## API Integration Details

### TAVUS API Endpoints Used

```javascript
// Creating a persona
POST https://tavusapi.com/v2/personas
{
  "persona_name": "Your Persona Name",
  "replica_id": "r_optional_replica_id", 
  "personality_layers": {
    "llm": {
      "model": "gpt-4",
      "system_prompt": "Your custom prompt",
      "context": "Additional context"
    },
    "tts": {
      "voice_settings": {
        "speed": "1.0",
        "emotion": ["neutral"]
      }
    }
  }
}

// Getting a persona
GET https://tavusapi.com/v2/personas/{persona_id}

// Listing all personas
GET https://tavusapi.com/v2/personas
```

### Headers Required
```javascript
{
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  'x-api-key': 'your-tavus-api-key'
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"TAVUS_API_KEY not configured"**
   - Ensure your TAVUS API key is set in environment variables
   - Check that the key has the correct permissions

2. **"Insufficient Tavus credits"**
   - Add credits to your TAVUS account
   - Upgrade your TAVUS plan if needed

3. **"Invalid Tavus API key"**
   - Verify your API key is correct
   - Check if the key has expired

4. **Persona created locally but not in TAVUS**
   - Check the browser console for error messages
   - The local persona will still work for basic features
   - Use the sync feature to retry TAVUS creation

### Manual Recovery

If personas were created before this fix and aren't linked to TAVUS:

1. **Option 1**: Use the sync feature to link existing TAVUS personas
2. **Option 2**: Create new personas (they will automatically integrate)
3. **Option 3**: Manually create TAVUS personas and sync them back

## Benefits of the Integration

✅ **Seamless Experience**: Create once, use everywhere
✅ **Full TAVUS Features**: Access to video generation, conversations, replicas
✅ **Automatic Linking**: No manual steps required
✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks if TAVUS is unavailable
✅ **Sync Capability**: Import existing TAVUS personas
✅ **Backward Compatible**: Existing personas continue to work

## Testing the Fix

To verify the integration is working:

1. Create a new persona through PersonaForge
2. Check your TAVUS dashboard - the persona should appear there
3. Try using TAVUS features like video generation with the new persona
4. The persona should work seamlessly across all TAVUS functionality

---

**Note**: This integration requires a valid TAVUS API key and active TAVUS account. Local persona creation will still work even if TAVUS integration fails, ensuring your workflow isn't interrupted.
